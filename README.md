**This is an exercise to work with branches.

First of all you will be given permission to work in this repository.
This repository contains:
	-index.html
	-style.css
	-style2.css
	-main.js
	-images directory

You will have to clone this repository so you can work with it.
Once this is done you will create a new branch to work on the file you get assigned.
(For example, if you are working on index.html, you should create a branch "indexBranch"..)
Every member of the team will work on different files.
Once you are happy with the changes you made, you will have to merge your branch to the master branch in the original repo.
(You will have to do a Pull request in order to achieve this)



Now we will create a conflict! Don't panic, conflicts can be solved.

You will want first to integrate the changes done by your team in your local repo.

Now two people will work on the same file (2 in the html, and 2 in the css) each will make the changes.
If the changes are done in the same line of the file, this will create a conflict when we try to pull the changes done by out team mates.

In order to solve the conflict, someone will have to decided which changes are we going to keep in our file, and the add and push to our master branch.
